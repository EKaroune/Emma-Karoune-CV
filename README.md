## Work experience
* **Research Associate and Community Manager for DECOVID project, The Alan Turing Institute** – 01/2021 to present. I am responsible for co-ordinating the different teams of data analysts and clinicians working on the project. I ensure communication is effective throughout the project by maintain the Github repositories, using different communication channels to pass on information and ensuring efficient workflow streams. I am also contributing to The Turing Way by writing new chapters concerning scientific communication such as how to write collaborative academic papers and how to deal with authorship on collaborative projects. 
* **Independent researcher (in collaboration with Historic England)** – 09/2019- present (2 days – supported by several research grants). Open archaeobotanical research specialising in phytolith analysis. I am currently working on two projects: i) an open project concerning the application of phytolith analysis on British Archaeological sites including investigations into the methodologies used in phytolith analysis to build more robust and reproducible methods; ii) the development of open science practices in phytolith research. The later project has focused initially on assessing the extent of open science in this field and starting to build an open research community (see my project page: https://osf.io/qp68n/). Moving forward, I am collaborating, with my newly formed working group, to expand and consolidate this community, and we have applied for a European Open Science Cloud Digital Life Science Grant to fund a FAIRification project, in which I will be the Principal Investigator.
